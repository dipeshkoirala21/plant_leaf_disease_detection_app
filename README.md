# Plant Leaf Disease Detection

## Overview
This project aims to provide a solution for detecting diseases in plant leaves through image analysis. Currently, it supports network requests for uploading images to a server for disease detection. A future update will integrate a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model for offline detection.

## Features
Image Upload: Users can upload images of plant leaves to the server for disease detection.
Future Updates: Integration of a TFLite model for offline disease detection.


# Steps to Run:

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
